The threadsafe package provides thread-safe operations for various data structures common in concurrent Go applications.

The interfaces provided by the package are generic, and attempt to be quite exhaustive feature wise. If a more minimal interface would be better aligned for your application, create it as needed.

All interface implementations in this package are thread-safe and can be used concurrently.

## Key Features

- Generic, thread-safe maps, sets, queues, heaps, and priority queues.
- Iterator-first APIs for idiomatic `range` loops.
- Multiple concurrency strategies (mutex, RWMutex, sync.Map) so you can pick the right trade-offs.

## Tests and benchmarks

The package provides a Makefile with targets for running tests and benchmarks:

```bash
make test
make bench
```
