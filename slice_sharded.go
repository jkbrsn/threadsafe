// shards proceed in parallel with zero contention.
//
// Using a ShardedSlice will reduce lock contention, retain atomicity at the API level, and
// allow for simple fall-back to a single mutex-backed slice.
//
// The slice returned by Flush() / Peek() concatenates shards in ascending index order. The
// order of items within each shard is preserved, but the overall order is only guaranteed
// per-shard, which is usually acceptable for buffer/queue-like workloads where ordering
// across goroutines is not critical.
