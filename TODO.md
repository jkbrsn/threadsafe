# todo

- Better function docs for the interfaces, example:
  - What happens if deleting a key that doesn't exist? Perhaps use similar wording to the `delete` built-in: The delete built-in function deletes the element with the specified key (m[key]) from the map. If m is nil or there is no such element, delete is a no-op.
  - Consider `Delete` in `Set`.
- Potentially
  - Add last-in-first-out queue?
